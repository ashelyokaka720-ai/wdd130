        <p>Hello! My name is Ashley Okaka and I am from Kampala, Uganda. I like listening to band music and adventure.
            I am studying Web Design and Development at BYU-Idaho. I am so excited to learn about web design and
            development. I am looking forward to creating my own website and more for other organisations. I am
            happy to be part of the Web Design and Development team.</p>

        <h2>UGANDA</h2>
        <img src="images/uganda.webp" alt="Beautiful scenery from Uganda">
        <p>Uganda, often called the "Pearl of Africa," is a land of breathtaking beauty and rich culture, where the
            mighty River Nile begins its journey and wildlife roams freely across lush savannahs and misty forests.
            Uganda's savannas, wetlands, and rainforests contribute to the country's remarkable natural beauty. With
            warm hospitality and a deep love for their homeland, Ugandans carry forward the spirit of a country that
            truly shines as Africaâ€™s most precious gem.</p>
